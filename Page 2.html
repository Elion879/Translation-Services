Jessica was twelve, a skinny freckled girl whose buttoned boots sat clumsily on feet accustomed to flaying bare over the stones on the mountain paths. Her dresses hung, when she wore them awkwardly about her boy’s body. Wisps of dark hair that would somehow escape the discipline of her plaits drifted across her forehead and into her eyes, brown and sparkling like treacle in the paleness of her face. 
    It was a starched, well-behaved Sunday that drove her out of the farmhouse and up the crooked path to the pool. Half an hour of a scrambling climb brought her to the entrance of the kloof [ravine], so green and cool in its stillness that she was hushed into reverence more sincere than the rustling piety of church.
     She glanced about quickly and went on. At each step the bushes sprang together behind her back, their leaves meshing into green chain mail against the arrows of village eyes that used to follow her everywhere. Along the path, deadened with damp leaves, she hurried. A rainbird repeated melancholy notes in the trees above, a pure hollow whistle that was always heard near the pool, where a thin waterfall misted the undergrowth. 
    The water was like the gin her father drank, clear and intoxicating, ice-cold. Her boots unbuttoned stiffly but her dress slipped off her thinness and lay in a forlorn heap of faded pink print near the grubby calico of her petticoat. She looked down with disgust at the small swelling under her vest that promised to put an end to boyhood, and cried.
    That was weak. Mortification made her jump into the shocking cold, gasping, splashing and laughing till she could stand no more. She Crawled, frozen, on to the basalt by the waterfall and lay wet-bloomered in the sunlight, gradually warmed and soothed into sleep.
     The shadow of the kloof crept stealthily up. She shivered, awoke and reached for her dress. Dislodged by her movement, a rock slithered and she fell, jarring her head on the stones. Diamonds flashed in her eyes. She lay stunned in the numbing water. Her hands were losing their hold on the slimy moss, slipping . . . I’m going to drown, she thought.
     Dimly through the spray, half-conscious, she saw something running. A man, small swift feet and a round belly. He was kneeling by the water’s edge stretching out his hands. Inert, devoid of will, she slipped out of reach. Then her fingers curled up suddenly with cramp and she screamed and thrashed the water with the icy pain. He leaned further, grasped her frantic wrist and dragged her over grumbling pebbles to safety. Gently he set her down on the grass.
     When she sat up at last and shook the wet hair out of her eyes, she saw that she was naked. He stood near her, bending forward and watching her intently with his face screwed up. He was yellow and deeply wrinkled like an ancient, jaundiced baby, beaded with sweat on the broad nose. His head was small and round, with grizzled peppercorn hair, bound over his brow with a black rag. 
    “Thank you”, she said, smiling and rubbing at the pins and needles in her feet.
    He dipped his head shyly and turned away. As he did so he picked a sprig of the grey bush that grew in the kloof, tossing it on to the pile of clothes. Jessica leaned over to pick it up, savouring the hereby smell of its crushed leaves in her hands, and when she looked again he was gone.
    Perhaps he had always been there when she visited the pool. Did he live there, she mused, deep in some smoky cave, his black eyes wary of her intrusions? Did he slip through the leaves behind her, watching, watching? She remembered that the bush often became unnaturally still, the monkeys silent in their trees until long after she had passed.
    It was comforting, this presence, and she thought that maybe the good Lord in his mercy had sent her a guardian angel since he had taken her mother away most cruelly. 


Going down was much quicker, but she got back to the farmhouse late, and fearful of Papa’s wrath if he found out where she’d been. He never went to church on Sunday but sat in his study with the soaring shelves of books and the autographed Cambridge racing oar that so proudly displayed his membership of the 1894 crew. It hadn’t been dusted since mama Mama died. By six o’clock the gin bottle would be empty and Papa would come stumbling out, sometimes grossly affectionate but more often growling with dissatisfaction and bile.  Then there was only Grampa to go to.
    He always sat, blasphemous, loving and quite blind, on the back veranda in the afternoons where he could soak up the last yellow rays before the mountains claimed the sun. His head nodded white against the creaky basket-work and his blank, blue sailor’s eyes were wickedly wrinkled at the corners where he screwed them up when laughed. Scandalous sea shanties fell from his lips as sweetly as forbidden honey, especially in the evenings when the black blanket of night drew down and his nose twitched at the sharp smell of the lamps being lit.
    ‘Jess!’ he would call. ‘Come and sit with me, girl, and I’ll sing you songs of the sea.’
     His voice had a rare huskiness that softened the harshness out of violent verses and left a hushing, lilting rhythm that was of the sea. The gum trees would shiver overhead in the breeze like the whisper of water against a moonlit ship.
     ‘Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter,
      Away you rolling river …’
or again, with a chuckle,
      ‘Fire in the fore-peak, fire down below;
       It’s fetch a bucket o’ water, girls, there’s fire down below.
       Fire, fire, fire down below,
       It’s fetch a bucket o’ water, girls, there’s fire down below.’
Sometimes she joined in, but not if Papa was in a bad way, for them he would go on about her shortcomings, especially the fact that she was not a boy.
      ‘Why did the Lord see fit to bless me with an ugly, drivelling female instead of a son, eh? Eh?’ He pinched her cheek hard with slightly moist fingers.
      Grampa in his helplessness would remonstrate, because he soon found that he could draw the displeasure on himself.
      ‘Ah, Donald, don’t be so hard on the child.’
      ‘Ah, you old parasite, keep your tongue to yourself!’
       Sober, Papa wore the mask of a gentleman, exaggeratedly polite to the lowliest servant, and to Jessica. He could be kind and even generous, but a shadow of drunkenness lay in the deep-sunk eyes that brooded over her, so that she was always very feminine and afraid in his presence. He was a big man, saturnine, with an air marred by his ill-temper and occasional bursts of sentiment.</p>
